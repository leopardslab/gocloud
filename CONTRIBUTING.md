# Contributing Guidelines

Welcome, and thanks in advance for your help! Please follow these simple guidelines :+1:

# How to contribute to nodecloud

## When you propose a new feature or bug fix

**Note:** Please make sure to write an issue first and get enough feedback before jumping into a Pull Request!

- Please make sure there is an open issue discussing your contribution
- If there isn't, please open an issue so we can talk about it before you invest time into the implementation
- When creating an issue follow the guide that GitHub shows so we have enough information about your proposal

## When you want to work on an existing issue

**Note:** Please write a quick comment in the corresponding issue and ask if the feature is still relevant and that you want to jump into the implementation.

## Reviewing Pull Requests

Another really useful way to contribute to nodecloud is to review other peoples Pull Requests. Having feedback from multiple people is really helpful and reduces the overall time to make a final decision about the Pull Request.

## Providing support

The easiest thing you can do to help us move forward and make an impact on our progress is to simply provide support to other people having difficulties with their nodecloud projects.

# Code Style

We aim for clean, consistent code style. We're using ESlint to check for codestyle issues using the Airbnb preset (you can run `npm run lint` to lint your code).

To help reduce the effort of creating contributions with this style, an [.editorconfig file](http://editorconfig.org/) is provided that your editor may use to override any conflicting global defaults and automate a subset of the style settings.

# Testing

We aim for a (near) 100% test coverage, so make sure your tests cover as much of your code as possible.

# Our Code of Conduct
